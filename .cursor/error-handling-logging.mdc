globs: ["**/*.cs"]

- Use middleware for global exception handling.
- Log exceptions with structured logging (e.g., Serilog).
- Avoid catching general `Exception` unless rethrowing or logging.
- Use `ProblemDetails` for API error responses.
- Implement proper error codes and messages for API consumers.
- Use correlation IDs for request tracing.
- Log at appropriate levels (Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Fatal).
- Include relevant context in log messages.
- Use structured logging with proper properties.
- Implement health checks for monitoring.
- Handle validation errors gracefully with proper HTTP status codes.
