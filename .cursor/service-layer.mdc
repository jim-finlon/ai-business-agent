globs: ["**/Services/*.cs"]

- Services should be stateless and injected via DI.
- Use async/await for all I/O operations.
- Return DTOs or domain models, not EF entities.
- Validate inputs using FluentValidation or guard clauses.
- Use proper error handling with custom exceptions.
- Implement proper logging for service operations.
- Use repository pattern for data access abstraction.
- Keep services focused on single responsibility.
- Use dependency injection for all dependencies.
- Implement proper cancellation token support for long-running operations.
