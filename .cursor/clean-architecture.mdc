- Controllers should only depend on application interfaces, not concrete implementations.
- Domain models must not reference infrastructure or external libraries.
- Use MediatR for application layer orchestration.
- Avoid business logic in controllers—delegate to services or handlers.
- Follow dependency inversion principle - depend on abstractions, not concretions.
- Keep controllers thin - they should only handle HTTP concerns.
- Use CQRS pattern for complex business operations.
- Implement proper separation of concerns between layers.
